Following S.O.L.I.D. principles

- Single responsibility principle;

    A class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class).
    
- Open/closed principle;

    "software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
    
- Liskov substitution principle;

    "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
    
- Interface segregation principle;

    "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
    
- Dependency inversion principle;

    One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

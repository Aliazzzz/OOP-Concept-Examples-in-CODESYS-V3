# Demonstrates the usage of the __New operator in CODESY3

# Use of this mechanism within production environments is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED

This example shows the usage of creating and destroying objects on demand in Runtime, which is common practice in the IT world's widely used object oriented programming languages. However, creating and or destroying objects in Runtime within a PAC /PLC /DCS memory is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED and should be avoided. Nevertheless the mechanism itself is definitely interesting from an academic and lab-environment point of view and has its specific purposes.
